Hi there! this is my final evaluation project for Adalab, hope you like it!
You can see the final product here: http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-Calpurniax/

> **First things first:** You need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run this project

### Steps to enjoy this lovely code I made:

2. **Install dependencies** by typing the following in a terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project! with:

```bash
npm start
```

## About the evaluation

It consists on developing a web-site using HTML and Css/Sass and JS using React as framework, with a free design. We were required to focus on JS side to practice some good stuff like:

- fetch
- array/objects
- React Router
- Components
- Github
- never forget our friends Css/HTML

#### About the code

The project was typed with Visual Studio Code.

### thank you and have fun!
